# dangerous_items_dataset_ver.1
The dataset can be used for object detection. It contains 4,000 images representing 5 classes of objects: baseball bat, gun, knife, machete and rifle. All images were scaled so that the smaller side is no shorter than 600 pixels and the larger one is no longer than 1,000 pixels. The full set was randomly divided into training and testing parts (75% and 25% of the full set respectively). As a result, the training part contains 3,000 images, and the testing part â€“ 1,000 images. Both parts are balanced, that is, they contain similar number of objects to be detected. Images were annotated using bounding boxes in the Pacal VOC format, according to which the description about each image is included in the corresponding XML file.
